                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Jann was born in South Africa in 1956 and after marrying her husband Bob, spent years moving around various African countries before finally settling in England. She taught pupils from all walks of life and was much loved by her colleagues and students.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After she died, my fiancé discovered her stash of recipes. A collection of mainly handwritten recipes from herself or from community cookbooks from her travels. As my fiancé likes to cook and I like to bake, I have been working on digitising this collection in the hopes of having a family cookbook that can be shared with family members.
